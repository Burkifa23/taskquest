# Gamified Task Manager - "TaskQuest"
*Solo Leveling / SAO inspired productivity system*

## Core Concept
Transform mundane tasks into an RPG-like progression system where users level up, earn rewards, and unlock new abilities by completing real-world tasks.

## üéÆ Progressive Feature Scope for Framework Testing

### **Week 1: Foundation & Basic Leveling**
**Character System:**
- User registration creates a "Hunter" profile (E-rank)
- Basic character stats (Level, XP, Rank)
- Simple XP calculation (Task completion = XP gained)
- Level progression (every 100 XP = level up)

**Task System:**
- Create tasks with difficulty ratings (Easy/Medium/Hard/Epic)
- Different XP rewards based on difficulty
- Basic CRUD operations for tasks
- Task completion triggers XP gain + visual feedback

**Core UI:**
- Character dashboard (level, XP bar, current rank)
- Task list with difficulty indicators
- Simple level-up notifications

### **Week 2: Rank System & Daily Quests**
**Ranking System:**
- Rank progression: E ‚Üí D ‚Üí C ‚Üí B ‚Üí A ‚Üí S ‚Üí National Level
- Rank-up ceremonies (special UI animations)
- Rank requirements (level + achievement criteria)

**Daily Quest System:**
- Auto-generated daily quests ("Complete 3 tasks", "Finish 1 Hard task")
- Bonus XP for daily quest completion
- Streak tracking with multiplier bonuses
- Quest reset at midnight

**Enhanced UI:**
- Rank badges and visual indicators
- Daily quest sidebar
- Streak counter with flame effects
- Progress bars with animations

### **Week 3: Achievement System & Skills**
**Achievement/Title System:**
- Unlock titles based on behavior ("Speedrunner", "Perfectionist", "Night Owl")
- Achievement gallery with progress tracking
- Special rewards for milestone achievements
- Title display on profile

**Skill Tree System:**
- Unlock skills through leveling ("Time Master", "Task Splitter", "Focus Mode")
- Skills provide gameplay benefits (bonus XP, task templates, etc.)
- Skill point allocation system
- Visual skill tree interface

**Social Features:**
- Public leaderboards (optional)
- Achievement sharing
- Rank comparison with friends

### **Week 4: Advanced Systems & Polish**
**Dungeon/Raid System:**
- Multi-day projects become "Dungeons"
- Break large projects into "dungeon floors"
- Boss battles (major milestones)
- Rare rewards for dungeon completion

**Advanced Gamification:**
- Equipment/Item system (cosmetic or functional)
- Guild system (team productivity)
- Special events (double XP weekends)
- Prestige system (reset with permanent bonuses)

**Polish & Performance:**
- Smooth animations and transitions
- Responsive design across devices
- Performance optimization for complex state
- Error handling and edge cases

## üéØ Framework Testing Focus Areas

### **State Management Complexity**
- **Week 1:** Basic user stats and XP tracking
- **Week 2:** Complex rank calculations and daily quest state
- **Week 3:** Achievement progress tracking and skill trees
- **Week 4:** Multi-system interactions and performance

### **Real-time Updates & Animations**
- XP gain animations and level-up effects
- Progress bar animations
- Real-time leaderboard updates
- Notification systems for achievements

### **Data Relationships**
- User ‚Üí Tasks ‚Üí XP ‚Üí Levels ‚Üí Ranks ‚Üí Achievements
- Complex queries for leaderboards and statistics
- Time-based calculations (streaks, daily resets)

### **UI/UX Complexity**
- Rich, game-like interfaces
- Complex animations and transitions
- Mobile-responsive gaming UI
- Dark/light theme switching

## üèóÔ∏è Technical Architecture

### **Core Data Models**
```
User {
  id, username, email, password
  level, currentXP, totalXP, rank
  titles[], activeTitle
  streakCount, lastActive
  skillPoints, unlockedSkills[]
}

Task {
  id, title, description, difficulty
  xpReward, status, createdAt, completedAt
  userId, tags[]
}

Achievement {
  id, name, description, icon
  requirement, progress, unlocked
  userId
}

DailyQuest {
  id, description, xpReward
  progress, completed, resetDate
  userId
}
```

### **XP & Progression Formulas**
```
XP Rewards:
- Easy Task: 10-20 XP
- Medium Task: 25-40 XP  
- Hard Task: 50-75 XP
- Epic Task: 100-150 XP

Level Requirements:
- Level n = (n * 100) + (n-1)^2 * 10

Rank Requirements:
- E‚ÜíD: Level 10
- D‚ÜíC: Level 25 + 5 achievements
- C‚ÜíB: Level 50 + 15 achievements
- B‚ÜíA: Level 100 + 30 achievements
- A‚ÜíS: Level 200 + 50 achievements
```
